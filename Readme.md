# log-stats
A tool that combines many logs from logs.tf to create statistics.

# Todo:
1. Figure out what to do with the data. What charts are useful, interesting, etc.
2. Figure out which data visualization library to use. C3?


# Todo later (things that aren't crucial right now):
1. Refactor logs.js code to make the control flow more logical.
2. Move logs.js code to the front-end.
3. Logs 2.0 and 1.0 compatibility. Missing damage, healing, etc. stat compatibility.
4. (?) Use axios instead of request
5. (?) Switch between server and client side data processing depending on the clients internet speed
