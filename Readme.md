# log-stats
A tool that combines many logs from logs.tf to create statistics.

# Todo:
1. Figure out what to do with the data. What charts are useful, interesting, etc.
2. Learn to use Webpack for module loading.
3. Load Babel for ES5 and ES6 polyfills and features.
4. Figure out which data visualization library to use.


# Todo later (things that aren't crucial right now):
1. Refactor logs.js code to make the control flow more logical.
2. Move logs.js code to the front-end.
3. (?) Use axios instead of request
4. (?) Switch between server and client side data processing depending on the clients internet speed
